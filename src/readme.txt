Hello, welcome to our game! 


This project was done by Ethan Reed and Taranvir Jovhall(REEDX500 JOHAL004).
It is composed into 5 files: 

(1. Board - generates a board
(2. Boats - generates boats represented by integers on the board
(3. Turns1 - this is most of the meat of the project, it has the thread that 
is used to play the game 
(4. Root - this takes in most of the individual instances of the objects and
cleanly plays the game allowing them to replay
(5. Battleboard - this is what is used to play the game!
 
Work was divided: 

Board: Ethan
Boats: Ethan
Turns1: Ethan and Taranvir
Root: Ethan
BattleBoard: Ethan

There are no special features besides (being able to quit early)
or bugs (that we are aware of). 

To run our code:

If using Itellij: 
(1. go into BattleBoard class
(2. run main

If using a terminal:
(1. go to the zip file using the terminal
(2. javac BattleBoard.java
(3. java BattelBoard.java
